# Grid System

A grid system can be use to align and size objects within a given format.

## Usage

- Basic rules that help you set up your pages in sketch.
- The responsive behavior of our grid has four breakpoints.
- The amount, width and spacing of the columns change with each breakpoint.
- **Exception!** The global header and footer live outside the bounds of the grid.
