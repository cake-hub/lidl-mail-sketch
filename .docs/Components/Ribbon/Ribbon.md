# Ribbons

Use ribbons to add unique selling prepositions or other information.

Basically it is positioned in a context with a product tile, teaser, or image.

---

## Overall styling

- The text-style is [small bold](../../General/Typography/Typography.md#small-bold).
- The line-height is **default**.

---

## Recommendations

- If you decide to use a ribbon, never use more than a **maximum of 2 variations** <br>*(our "info" ribbon matches our brand-primary color due to the purpose of the color "blue")*.

---

## Variants

- The ribbon has 3 colored variations: **primary**, **highlight**, **gray** and **info**.

| Variants | Attributes | Preview |
|---|---|---|
| primary | text-color: basic-white<br>background-color: brand-primary-base | ![info](assets/ribbon-primary@1x.png) |
