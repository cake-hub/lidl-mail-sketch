# Teaser

Use the teaser component to attract attention and build excitement and expectations through curiosity.

---

## Recommendations

- The teaser is a placeholder element that is placed in the appropriate size.
- The teaser and it’s look are determined by content.
- The font of the teaser is maintained in the image.
- The teaser arrangement can be freely adjusted and combined.
- Try to keep the 4:3 ratio for teasers to guarantee the right display in each breakpoint.
- Otherwise it’s ratio is completely free adjustable.

---

## Overall styling

- The image has a **free ratio**.
- The image should be **divisible by 8**.
- The teasers are provided in **3 heights** for every breakpoint **148px, 200px, 312px**.
- Only in tablet view the teasers are povided in **full width and half width**.

---

## Spacing & Measurements

- In the tablet view (SM) it is possible to place the teasers in four or two columns.
- In the smartphone view (XS) place only one teaser over two column to guarantee a readable view for the user.
